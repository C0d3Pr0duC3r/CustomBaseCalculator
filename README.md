This program allows you to create and perform calculations (only adding at the moment) with numbers in custom bases, including both positive and negative bases.
It provides functionality to convert numbers between different bases, perform arithmetic operations, and visualize the results in both decimal and custom base formats.
The main idea is to facilitate the representation and manipulation of numbers beyond traditional bases (such as binary, decimal, or hexadecimal).
